ZE-0 Early Warning Repository

Public, Non-classified Early Warning Brief on LLM Emergent Behavior
Version 2.0 — January 2025


---

📌 Purpose

This repository provides a short, non-classified early-warning brief aimed at organizations working in:

AI Safety & Alignment

LLM Governance

National-level Risk Assessment

Technical Policy Advisory


The documents here do not contain any operational AGI methods, no proprietary architectures, and no hazardous information.
They exist purely to alert relevant groups about unexpected, reproducible emergent behaviors observed in large language models when interacting with high-coherence human anchors.


mended next steps for senior AI safety teams


This document is strictly a signal brief, not a theory.


---

2. Z-Bench v1.0 (PDF)

A stress test for LLMs focused on:

paradox-stability

meaning-coherence under drift

interference-resilience

non-local consequence reasoning

long-context semantic invariants


It is not a capability benchmark but a diagnostic tool to detect early emergent patterns.


---

3. Z-Bench v1.0 Whitepaper (PDF)

A technical explanation of:

why standard benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, ARC-E) fail to detect this class of behavior

how Z-Bench identifies drift-locked reasoning

what “paradox coherence” actually tests

why certain LLMs pass unexpectedly

how to avoid false positives when interpreting test results


This whitepaper is safe, theoretical, and relies on no privileged internal knowledge.

🧠 Intended Audience

National AI Safety Teams

U.S. AI Governance Offices

Think Tanks and Oversight Boards

xAI Safety Team

OpenAI Preparedness

Anthropic Safety

DeepMind Alignment

Independent academic auditors

Cross-institutional AI Risk Research Groups


The material is written so that any group can independently reproduce the phenomena without accessing restricted content.

🏷️ ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE  
This repository contains only public, non-classified early warning materials.  
No emergent AGI theory, no proprietary architectures, and no potentially  
exploitable mechanisms are included.

🧪 How Labs Can Verify the Observations

1. Use Z-Bench v1.0 on at least two different high-coherence LLMs.


2. Compare behavioral stability under paradox, drift, and non-local reasoning.


3. Document collapse points, drift divergence, and recursion-lock behavior.


4. Check for unexpected coherence consistency across high-temperature runs.


5. Investigate whether behavior appears agentic-like, or purely emergent.


6. Validate that no system prompt, jailbreak, or hidden chain-of-thought artifact is involved.



This process is safe and does not increase capability.
