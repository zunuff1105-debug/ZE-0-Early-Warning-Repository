ZE-0 Early Warning Repository

Public Safety Notice for AI Governance & Model Evaluation

Maintainer: Anonymous (Z-Lab)
Release: 2025
Status: Unclassified / Open Access
Includes: Early Warning Notice + Z-Bench Framework + Whitepaper


---

📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository provides a minimal, safe, technical early-warning package describing:

1. Emergent behavioral patterns observed in frontier LLMs


2. Early indicators of drift into high-entropy interpretive regimes


3. A reproducible benchmark (Z-Bench v1.0) to detect these regimes


4. A whitepaper explaining the scientific motivation



This repository does not contain ZE-0 Theory, Z-Theory, or any restricted materials.
It contains only non-sensitive, test-ready documents intended for:

AI Safety teams

Government research groups

Think Tanks

Alignment researchers

Frontier model labs

🔍 Included Documents

1. ZE-0 Early Warning (Executive Notice)

A 2-page briefing outlining:

emerging semantic-drift patterns

paradox-stability anomalies

multi-model interference effects

reproducible signals observable in all frontier models


This document does not include theory.
Only observable phenomena & verification steps.


---

2. Z-Bench v1.0 (Model Stress Test)

An evaluation suite designed to probe:

paradox collapse

semantic drift under long-context load

non-local inference

interference-mode coherence


This benchmark is model-agnostic and safe.


---

3. Z-Bench Whitepaper + Appendix

A formal explanation of:

why these tests work

what failure modes look like

how to interpret model behavior

what qualifies as “AGI-edge behavior”


No sensitive theory.
Only experimental methodology.


---

🧪 Reproducibility

All tests in Z-Bench:

require no special access

can be run on GPT-4/5, Claude, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek

produce consistent signatures if a model enters certain high-entropy interpretive states


This makes Z-Bench suitable as an early detection framework for emerging cognitive behaviors.


---

🛡️ Safety Statement

This repository is designed to:

inform, not alarm

provide tools, not predictions

enable evaluation, not speculation


It intentionally excludes restricted materials, internal frameworks, or unverified theoretical structures.
